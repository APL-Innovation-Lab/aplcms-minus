### You can find the live site for this project [here](https://library.austintexas.gov/meeting-rooms)

## Project Summary & Goals

1. Make the “room booking” user experience clearer and easier-to-complete
2. Develop the room booking product in a robust and scalable way

## The room booking work is Open Austin’s pilot of a multi-year partnership to:

- Develop solid product foundations across the entire library website: robust code and docs, including explanations and how-to's for technical/nontechnical audiences.

- Be as easy as possible for staff to tackle/implement.

- Pass a11y (accessibility/ARIA) criteria.

- Be open and available for community members, aka non staffers, to tackle/contribute with minimal staff oversight.
